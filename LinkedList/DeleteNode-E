/ we will delete next node but pretend that present node is deleted as we will replace present value with next node value and delete next node.
\

class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        // Since we know input node is not last node, so nextNode will not be null
        ListNode nextNode = node.next;
        // Step 2
        node.val = nextNode.val;
        // Step 3
        node.next = nextNode.next;
    }
}
