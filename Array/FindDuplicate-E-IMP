//The size of the array is at least N+1 with N integer. It means if we start from item at index 0, all the N+1 items from index 0 to index N will be visited.
//The number we want to find will be visited at least twice, which makes the existence of cycle a definite!
//it will be solved same as we solve cycle in linked list ;
